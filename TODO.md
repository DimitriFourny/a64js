# Instruction Support TODO

This file is a work queue, not a scratchpad. Each Codex run should take one `Ready` work item, finish it end-to-end, then update this file before stopping.

## Workflow

### Execution rule

Pick exactly one work item from `Ready`, unless a task is already listed under `In Progress`.

### What a work item must contain

- one coherent instruction family or cleanup batch
- enough scope to justify a full implementation pass
- concrete XML and/or source-YAML anchors
- a short `Done when` checklist

### What to do during a Codex run

1. Claim one work item by moving it to `In Progress`.
2. Implement decode/disasm support for the whole batch, not a single encoding unless the item explicitly says so.
3. Update `tools/supported-files.ts` only when the family works end-to-end.
4. Run the relevant generation and test commands.
5. Move the item to `Done` with a short result note, or to `Blocked` with the reason.

### Refresh commands

```sh
bun tools/generate.ts
bun test
```

## In Progress

- None.

## Ready

Priority rule:

- prefer the most-used and most broadly expected instruction families first
- use the capstone snapshot and `basic-a64-instructions.s.yaml` volume as the default tie-breaker
- only take niche SME/SVE/AdvSIMD work ahead of scalar/core A64 work when it clearly removes a larger unsupported batch

### Scalar load/store immediate and unscaled family

Scope:

- implement the common scalar general-purpose load/store families before narrower architectural cleanup
- cover the immediate and unscaled forms as one coherent batch instead of one mnemonic at a time
- include shared decode/disasm operand handling for base-plus-immediate addressing with `sp`
- promote the matching XML files into `tools/supported-files.ts` only after the family is correct end-to-end

Anchors:

- `basic-a64-instructions.s.yaml`: highest-value remaining source file at `1180` unsupported cases
- primary XML families include `ldr_imm_gen.xml`, `str_imm_gen.xml`, `ldur_gen.xml`, `stur_gen.xml`
- adjacent scalar families likely worth batching if operand logic is shared: `ldrb_imm.xml`, `ldrh_imm.xml`, `strb_imm.xml`, `strh_imm.xml`, `ldrsw_imm.xml`

Done when:

- the targeted scalar load/store XML families decode correctly
- `disasm()` renders canonical base-plus-immediate forms like `ldr w8, [sp, #0x3c]` instead of `.inst`
- supported-file entries and generated fixtures are updated together
- tests pass after regeneration

### SME2 BF16 subtraction completion

Scope:

- finish the remaining SME2 BF16 subtraction family work
- cover the outstanding decode/disasm paths as a single batch
- promote the matching XML files into `tools/supported-files.ts` only after the family is correct end-to-end

Anchors:

- primary theme from the current unsupported backlog: remaining SME2 BF16 subtraction work
- likely impact is concentrated in `basic-a64-instructions.s.yaml` and related BF16 XML families

Done when:

- the remaining SME2 BF16 subtraction XML families decode correctly
- `disasm()` no longer falls back to `.inst` for the newly supported capstone cases
- supported-file entries and generated fixtures are updated together
- tests pass after regeneration

### SVE predicate and compare cleanup batch

Scope:

- finish the remaining SVE predicate/compare cleanup left after the recent `cmpeq`, `ptrue`, `ptrues`, `frinta`, and scalar prefetch work
- treat related XML families as one batch where they share operand/guard behavior

Anchors:

- current backlog note: remaining SVE predicate cleanup
- highest-value source files still include `neon-compare-instructions.s.yaml` and other SVE-heavy capstone shards

Done when:

- the targeted predicate/compare XML families are implemented as a coherent batch
- feature guards still behave correctly in `decode()`
- regenerated fixtures and tests reflect the reduction in `.inst` fallbacks

### AdvSIMD high-volume cleanup batch

Scope:

- attack the remaining high-count AdvSIMD backlog as a family-oriented batch instead of one XML at a time
- prioritize shared formatter/operand patterns before isolated one-off instructions

Anchors:

- `neon-simd-misc.s.yaml`: `260`
- `neon-simd-shift.s.yaml`: `159`
- `neon-3vdiff.s.yaml`: `142`
- `neon-simd-ldst-one-elem.s.yaml`: `128`

Done when:

- at least one coherent AdvSIMD family group is fully promoted to supported
- the work item records which XML families were completed
- generation and tests pass

## Blocked

- None.

## Done

Use one line per completed work item with a concise outcome note. Keep detailed history below in `Completed Families`.

- None yet in this workflow format.

## Snapshot

Current capstone coverage snapshot:

- `17763` supported capstone cases
- `16858` unsupported capstone cases
- `201` XML instruction files currently listed in `tools/supported-files.ts`
- `1686` distinct unsupported XML instruction files
- `896` capstone source YAML files containing unsupported cases
- `911` distinct unsupported mnemonics

Highest-value remaining source files right now:

- `basic-a64-instructions.s.yaml`: `1180`
- `neon-simd-misc.s.yaml`: `260`
- `neon-compare-instructions.s.yaml`: `180`
- `neon-simd-shift.s.yaml`: `159`
- `neon-3vdiff.s.yaml`: `142`
- `neon-simd-ldst-one-elem.s.yaml`: `128`

Largest unsupported feature sets:

- `FEAT_SVE || FEAT_SME, FEAT_SVE, FEAT_SME`: `4111`
- `FEAT_SME2`: `2253`
- `FEAT_SVE2 || FEAT_SME, FEAT_SVE2, FEAT_SME`: `2030`
- `FEAT_AdvSIMD`: `1882`
- `FEAT_SME2 || FEAT_SVE2p1, FEAT_SME2, FEAT_SVE2p1`: `1329`
- no feature gate recorded: `935`
- `FEAT_SME`: `778`
- `FEAT_SVE2p1 || FEAT_SME2p1, FEAT_SVE2p1, FEAT_SME2p1`: `774`
- `FEAT_SME_B16B16`: `408`
- `FEAT_SVE`: `392`

Implication:

- the remaining work is still concentrated in SVE, SME, SME2, and AdvSIMD
- the next highest-value batches are family work, not one-off instruction fixes
- the first priority should still be common scalar/core A64 families from `basic-a64-instructions.s.yaml` when they have large unsupported batches

## Meaning Of "Unsupported"

This repository keeps committed capstone fixtures under `test/generated/capstone/`, split by source YAML file.

A case is counted as `unsupported` only when all of the following are true:

1. The instruction word matches an Arm XML encoding.
2. That XML file is not in `tools/supported-files.ts`.
3. `disasm()` still falls back to raw `.inst 0x...`.

So this TODO tracks instructions that already map cleanly to XML encodings, but are not yet promoted into the supported set.

## Working Notes

- Do not add XML files to `tools/supported-files.ts` until both `decode()` and `disasm()` behave correctly for that family.
- The generated capstone corpus is a progress metric, not the whole instruction universe.
- The recent system-register work formats generic system-register operands as `S<op0>_<op1>_C<CRn>_C<CRm>_<op2>`. That is acceptable for coverage and should not block further family support.
- `tools/encodings.ts` needs to tolerate feature terms inside larger guard expressions; keep that in mind when working on mixed-guard XMLs.
- If `MOVA`-related capstone accounting does not move as expected, verify the XML-to-case mapping before assuming the formatter is wrong.
